      <description>The following is an overview for querying Elasticsearch. Over the years I have tried to assemble developer notes for myself and my team on a variety of platforms, languages and frameworks, a type of cheat-sheet but with context, not a comprehensive how-to, but a decent 15-minute overview of the features we are most likely to implement in a given iteration.
Explore the Elasticsearch official documentation: Search in Depth.
 Contents     Motivation Following Along with Elasticsearch and Kubernetes Vocabulary Basic CRUD API  Delete an Index Create an Index Create or Update a Document (Upsert) Get a Document  Mappings, Types and Metadata  Get Mapping Create a Mapping  Searching Range Filtering Aggregations  Counts Averages, Minimums and Maximums Percentile Percent by Rank Percent by Rank Interval  Resources     Motivation My team and I work with a lot of SQL-based data, from MySQL, SQLite and even our large Cassandra cluster, however, our reporting systems are built on Elasticsearch.</description>

      <title>SQL Foundations</title>

      <description>The following is an attempt at explaining the basics of an SQL query, and more importantly how I believe you can best think through them. All queries can be broken down into the basics of this declarative language.
I recently helped a co-worker read through a large SQL query with a few dozen joins and left joins, alias, and recursions. He is mostly a front-end integrator and although he has been tinkering with SQL for years, he never really understood the basics.</description>

      <description>We live in a world of process isolation and tools that make utilizing it extremely simple, with apps like Docker we can perform dependency management with dependency isolation. As I am slowly becoming a fanboy of containerization, I look forward to the day when typing ps on my local workstation or remote server is nearly synonymous with commands like docker ps or kubectl get services.
Case: Cassandra development and your local workstation.</description>
