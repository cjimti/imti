            Blockchain technologies have been made famous by Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the concepts behind Blockchain are far more reaching than their support for cryptocurrency. Blockchain technologies now support any digital asset, from signal data to complex messaging, to the execution of business logic through code. Blockchain technologies are rapidly forming a new decentralized internet of transactions.
Kubernetes is an efficient and productive platform for the configuration, deployment, and management of private blockchains.

            kubefwd helps to enable a seamless and efficient way to develop applications and services on a local workstation. Locally develop applications that intend to interact with other services in a Kubernetes cluster. kubefwd allows applications with connection strings like http://elasticsearch:9200/ or tcp://db:3306 to communicate into the remote cluster. kubefwd can be used to reduce or eliminate the need for local environment specific connection configurations.
Developing services in a Microservices architecture presents local development challenges, especially when the service you are developing needs to interact with a mixture of other services.

            FaaS or Function as a Service also known as Serverless computing implementations are gaining popularity. Discussed often are the cost savings and each implementations relationship to the physical and network architecture of a specific platform or vendor. While many of the cost and infrastructure advantages of FaaS are compelling, its only one of many advantages. Below, I hope to demonstrate how easy it is to develop and deploy FaaS components into a custom Kubernetes cluster.

            Developing on our local workstations has always been a conceptual challenge for my team when it comes to remote data access. Local workstation-based development of services that intend to connect to a wide range of remote services that may have no options for external connections poses a challenge. Mirroring the entire development environment is possible in many cases, just not practical.
In days before Kubernetes, writing code in IDEs on our local workstation meant we had only a few options for developing server-side-API-style services that needed to connect to a database.

            Basic Auth is one of the oldest and easiest ways to secure a web page or API endpoint. Basic Auth does not have many features and lacks the sophistication of more modern access controls (see Ingress Nginx Auth Examples). However, Basic Auth is supported by nearly every major web client, library, and utility. Basic Auth is secure, stable and perfect for quick security on Kubernetes projects. Basic Auth can easily we swapped out later as requirements demand or provide a foundation for implementations such as OAuth 2 and JWT.

            Helm is the official package manager for Kubernetes. If you are looking to start using Helm or want to test its capabilities, I suggest you set up a Production Hobby Cluster. This article is a continuation of the Production Hobby Cluster configuration but should be entirely useful on its own.
 From https://github.com/kubernetes/helm - Helm has two parts: a client (helm) and a server (tiller) - Tiller runs inside of your Kubernetes cluster and manages releases (installations) of your charts.

            There are more than a handful of ways to set up port 80 and 443 web ingress on a custom Kubernetes cluster. Specifically a bare metal cluster. If you are looking to experiment or learn on a non-production cluster, but something more true to production than minikube, I suggest you check out my previous article Production Hobby Cluster, a step-by-step guide for setting up a custom production capable Kubernetes cluster.

            I use a few Kubernetes clusters on a daily basis, and I use kubectl to access and configure them from my workstation. There are dozens of ways to configure kubectl however I find the following method the easiest for me to manage and not make a mess.
I also set up test clusters from time-to-time, and so keeping my configs organized is, so I don&rsquo;t confuse myself or make a mess.

            Just set up a brand new cluster? Changed the domain or IP of your admin node? Then you may have encountered the error Unable to connect to the server: x509: certificate is valid for &hellip;. The following is a fix for this common issue. However, there are often other reasons to rebuild your cluster cert, and it&rsquo;s relatively easy.
TL;DR: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about the fix I need to remote control my cluster.

            Setting up a production-grade Kubernetes cluster can be done on a hobby budget, and if this is true why mess around with a lesser grade. If you are investing time to learn distributed cloud computing or microservices, is the distance between $0 and 15 dollars a month worth the time in translating best practices? Kubernetes is designed to host production applications. My personal web applications may only be hobbies, but they might as well be production grade hobbies.

            When setting up nginx ingress on Kubernetes for a private Docker Registry, I ran into an error when trying to push an image to it.
Error parsing HTTP response: invalid character '&lt;' looking for beginning of value: &quot;&lt;html&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;413 Request Entity Too Large&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\r\n&lt;body bgcolor=\&quot;white\&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;413 Request Entity Too Large&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;hr&gt;&lt;center&gt;nginx/1.9.14&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n&quot;  The &ldquo;413 Request Entity Too Large&rdquo; error is something many accustomed to running nginx as a standard web server/proxy. nginx is configured to restrict the size of files it will allow over a post.

            I use Minikube to run a local Kubernetes single node cluster (cluster?). However, I also work with a custom production cluster for work. This cluster consists of development and production nodes. I often need to switch between working on my local Minikube and the online Kubernetes cluster.
TIP: Visit the kubectl Cheat Sheet often.
