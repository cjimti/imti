Below, I hope to demonstrate how easy it is to develop and deploy FaaS components into a custom Kubernetes cluster.</description>

      <description>This article is a quick tour of basic Python 3 syntax, components and structure. I intend to balance a cheat sheet format with hello world style boilerplate. If you are already a software developer and need a quick refresh on Python then I hope you benefit from my notes below.
I am a professional software developer for a software development company, and for that reason, I work with a lot of languages, expert in some, and ok in others.</description>
