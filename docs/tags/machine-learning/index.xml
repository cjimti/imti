      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been distracted for over a year now, writing a (~500 page) end-to-end tutorial on constructing data-centric platforms with Kubernetes. The book is titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3hAZUvx&#34;&gt;Advanced Platform Development with Kubernetes: Enabling Data Management, the Internet of Things, Blockchain, and Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A little more than a year ago, Apress reached out and asked if I would write a book on Kubernetes for them, mirroring the wide range of projects I develop (and write about) for my clients. I have been building data-centric platforms for almost twenty years, spanning everything from my early days on the aggregation of massive volumes of international log files for Disney to fan-driven location data for Nine Inch Nails. And in the last decade, retailers with point-of-sale, logistics, and inventory systems, marketers leveraging social media metrics, fleet operators with demanding telematics platforms, and manufacturers with advanced IIoT (industrial internet of things) networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
