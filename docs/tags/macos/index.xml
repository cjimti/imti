      <description>I have had this collection of old external drives hanging around for years. There was a time I was having terrible luck with hard drives. It turned out I managed to amass a collection of about eight drives from one terabyte to four terabytes.
Fortunately, I keep copies of nearly all my files on cloud drives, split between Amazon, Google and DropBox. I had a sneaking suspicion that the discs themselves were ok and somehow my Mac was communicating with the RAID controllers in a way that caused them to fail.</description>
