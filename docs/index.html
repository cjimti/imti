Blockchain technologies now support any digital asset, from signal data to complex messaging, to the execution of business logic through code. Blockchain technologies are rapidly forming a new decentralized internet of transactions.
Kubernetes is an efficient and productive platform for the configuration, deployment, and management of private blockchains.

            kubefwd helps to enable a seamless and efficient way to develop applications and services on a local workstation. Locally develop applications that intend to interact with other services in a Kubernetes cluster. kubefwd allows applications with connection strings like http://elasticsearch:9200/ or tcp://db:3306 to communicate into the remote cluster. kubefwd can be used to reduce or eliminate the need for local environment specific connection configurations.
Developing services in a Microservices architecture presents local development challenges, especially when the service you are developing needs to interact with a mixture of other services.

            FaaS or Function as a Service also known as Serverless computing implementations are gaining popularity. Discussed often are the cost savings and each implementations relationship to the physical and network architecture of a specific platform or vendor. While many of the cost and infrastructure advantages of FaaS are compelling, its only one of many advantages. Below, I hope to demonstrate how easy it is to develop and deploy FaaS components into a custom Kubernetes cluster.

            The following is an overview for querying Elasticsearch. Over the years I have tried to assemble developer notes for myself and my team on a variety of platforms, languages and frameworks, a type of cheat-sheet but with context, not a comprehensive how-to, but a decent 15-minute overview of the features we are most likely to implement in a given iteration.

            Developing on our local workstations has always been a conceptual challenge for my team when it comes to remote data access. Local workstation-based development of services that intend to connect to a wide range of remote services that may have no options for external connections poses a challenge. Mirroring the entire development environment is possible in many cases, just not practical.
In days before Kubernetes, writing code in IDEs on our local workstation meant we had only a few options for developing server-side-API-style services that needed to connect to a database.

            IOT devices, Point-of-Sale systems, application events or any client that sends data destined for indexing in Elasticsearch often need to send and forget, however, unless that data is of low value there needs to be assurance that arrives at its final destination. Back-pressure and database outages can pose a considerable threat to data integrity.

Kubernetes and GitlabCI are the central components of our DevOps toolchain and have increased our productivity by many multiples over the traditional approaches of the past.

            There is an overwhelming number of options for developers needing to provide data visualization. The most popular library for data visualization in Python is Matplotlib, and built directly on top of Matplotlib is Seaborn. The Seaborn library is &ldquo;tightly integrated with the PyData stack, including support for numpy and pandas data structures and statistical routines from scipy and statsmodels.&rdquo;
This article is only intended to get you started with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

            Many of the resources on Cloud Native Microservices show you how easy it is to get up and running with AWS or GKE. I think this is great but for the fact that I see a trend (in my clients at least) of associating concepts with particular products or worse, companies. I love Amazon, but it&rsquo;s not THE cloud). In my opinion, to embrace Cloud Native and Microservices you should develop some, and host them yourself.

            Pandas bring Python a data type equivalent to super-charged spreadsheets. Pandas add two highly expressive data structures to Python, Series and DataFrame. Pandas Series and DataFrames provide a performant analysis and manipulation of “relational” or “labeled” data similar to relational database tables like MySQL or the rows and columns of Excel. Pandas are great for working with time series data as well as arbitrary matrix data, and unlabeled data.

            Reverse proxies are standard components in many web architectures, from Nginx in front of php-fpm serving Drupal or Wordpress, to endless mixtures of load balancers, security appliances, and popular firewall applications. Reverse proxies differ from forward proxies in little but their intended implementation, be it service-side or client side. The following information is useful in either context. However, I focus on a service-side architecture. Further down this article, I&rsquo;ll be going over the reasonably simple go code needed to develop a basic, yet production quality proxy, but first I&rsquo;ll give you my take on why they solve so many problems and offer up my little workhorse, n2proxy.

            Jupyter Notbooks have been a popular technology in the Python data science community for a while now, especially in academics. Jupyter Notebooks are a way to mix inline, executable code with documentation in a presentation format. Best practices in organizing source code are not always the most efficient at communicating it&rsquo;s functionality to a user.
While the intention of a programming language is the abstraction of computational complexity into a simplified language humans can read and write, they must always weigh toward the efficiency of the primary interpreter, the computer.

            This article is a quick tour of basic Python 3 syntax, components and structure. I intend to balance a cheat sheet format with hello world style boilerplate. If you are already a software developer and need a quick refresh on Python then I hope you benefit from my notes below.
I am a professional software developer for a software development company, and for that reason, I work with a lot of languages, expert in some, and ok in others.

            Using ingress-nginx on Kubernetes makes adding CORS headers painless. Kubernetes ingress-nginx uses annotations as a quick way to allow you to specify the automatic generation of an extensive list of common nginx configuration options.
Example ingress configuration enabling CORS:
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: api namespace: fuse labels: app: api annotations: nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/enable-cors: &quot;true&quot; nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-allow-methods: &quot;PUT, GET, POST, OPTIONS&quot; nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-allow-origin: &quot;https://admin.example.com&quot; nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/cors-allow-credentials: &quot;true&quot; spec: rules: - host: api.example.com http: paths: - backend: serviceName: api-example servicePort: 80 path: /api tls: - hosts: - api.

            Basic Auth is one of the oldest and easiest ways to secure a web page or API endpoint. Basic Auth does not have many features and lacks the sophistication of more modern access controls (see Ingress Nginx Auth Examples). However, Basic Auth is supported by nearly every major web client, library, and utility. Basic Auth is secure, stable and perfect for quick security on Kubernetes projects. Basic Auth can easily we swapped out later as requirements demand or provide a foundation for implementations such as OAuth 2 and JWT.

            txToken is a small high performance microservice utility container. txToken is used for adding JSON Web Token based security to existing or new API development. txToken is specifically for systems that communicate in JSON over HTTP. txToken is called from a client with a JSON post body and passes received JSON to a remote endpoint. JSON retrieved from a remote endpoint is used to create a JWT token with an HS256 symmetrically encrypted signature.

            Use cert-manager to get port 443/https running with signed x509 certificates for Ingress on your Kubernetes Production Hobby Cluster. cert-manager is the successor to kube-lego and the preferred way to &ldquo;automatically obtain browser-trusted certificates, without any human intervention.&rdquo; using Let&rsquo;s Encrypt.
You need to install Helm first if you do not already have it. Otherwise, check out my article Helm on Custom Kubernetes, especially if you are following along with my Production Hobby Cluster guides.

            Helm is the official package manager for Kubernetes. If you are looking to start using Helm or want to test its capabilities, I suggest you set up a Production Hobby Cluster. This article is a continuation of the Production Hobby Cluster configuration but should be entirely useful on its own.
 From https://github.com/kubernetes/helm - Helm has two parts: a client (helm) and a server (tiller) - Tiller runs inside of your Kubernetes cluster and manages releases (installations) of your charts.

            Customize the Upstream Nameservers used by kube-dns by Pods when looking up external hostnames from within a Kubernetes cluster. I found that adding custom Upstream Nameservers to my kube-dns solved many issues encountered in in the past with external hostname resolution on individual Pods.
If you want to experiment on a production-like cluster, I suggest reading my article &ldquo;Production Hobby Cluster&rdquo; for a guide on setting up a fun, cheap-yet-robust experimental cluster.

            There are more than a handful of ways to set up port 80 and 443 web ingress on a custom Kubernetes cluster. Specifically a bare metal cluster. If you are looking to experiment or learn on a non-production cluster, but something more true to production than minikube, I suggest you check out my previous article Production Hobby Cluster, a step-by-step guide for setting up a custom production capable Kubernetes cluster.
