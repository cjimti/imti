      <title>Kubernetes Port Forwarding for Local Development</title>

      <description>kubefwd helps to enable a seamless and efficient way to develop applications and services on a local workstation. Locally develop applications that intend to interact with other services in a Kubernetes cluster. kubefwd allows applications with connection strings like http://elasticsearch:9200/ or tcp://db:3306 to communicate into the remote cluster. kubefwd can be used to reduce or eliminate the need for local environment specific connection configurations.
Developing services in a Microservices architecture presents local development challenges, especially when the service you are developing needs to interact with a mixture of other services.</description>

      <title>FaaS on Kubernetes</title>

      <description>FaaS or Function as a Service also known as Serverless computing implementations are gaining popularity. Discussed often are the cost savings and each implementations relationship to the physical and network architecture of a specific platform or vendor. While many of the cost and infrastructure advantages of FaaS are compelling, its only one of many advantages. Below, I hope to demonstrate how easy it is to develop and deploy FaaS components into a custom Kubernetes cluster.</description>

      <title>Elasticsearch Essential Queries</title>

      <description>The following is an overview for querying Elasticsearch. Over the years I have tried to assemble developer notes for myself and my team on a variety of platforms, languages and frameworks, a type of cheat-sheet but with context, not a comprehensive how-to, but a decent 15-minute overview of the features we are most likely to implement in a given iteration.
Explore the Elasticsearch official documentation: Search in Depth.
 Contents     Motivation Following Along with Elasticsearch and Kubernetes Vocabulary Basic CRUD API  Delete an Index Create an Index Create or Update a Document (Upsert) Get a Document  Mappings, Types and Metadata  Get Mapping Create a Mapping  Searching Range Filtering Aggregations  Counts Averages, Minimums and Maximums Percentile Percent by Rank Percent by Rank Interval  Resources     Motivation My team and I work with a lot of SQL-based data, from MySQL, SQLite and even our large Cassandra cluster, however, our reporting systems are built on Elasticsearch.</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t Install Emacs</title>

      <description>I grew up on emacs. One of my first jobs I sat down at a terminal and was editing some files with pico, it&amp;rsquo;s what I knew since I used that fantastic email client pine. I was quickly told by my the lead developer that I need to use a real text editor if I&amp;rsquo;m going to progress in my career. He told me I need to try emacs, and after suffering through a few weeks of memorizing multi command-char sequences and training the muscle memory in my pinky to perform bizarre contortions of my left hand just to save my file, I became a convert.</description>

      <description>We live in a world of process isolation and tools that make utilizing it extremely simple, with apps like Docker we can perform dependency management with dependency isolation. As I am slowly becoming a fanboy of containerization, I look forward to the day when typing ps on my local workstation or remote server is nearly synonymous with commands like docker ps or kubectl get services.
Case: Cassandra development and your local workstation.</description>

      <description>Getting started with Kubernetes for local development. I develop on a Mac however much of this is easily translated to windows.
The following is primarily a getting started guide wrapped around my personal development notes. This set of notes are specifically for my co-workers in helping them get up to speed quickly. If you see an error feel free to make a pull request or just add an issue.</description>
