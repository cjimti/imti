I grew up on [emacs]. One of my first jobs I sat down at a terminal and was editing some files with [pico], it's what I knew since I used that fantastic email client [pine]. I was quickly told by my the lead developer that I need to use a **real** text editor if I'm going to progress in my career. He told me I need to try [emacs], and after suffering through a few weeks of memorizing multi command-char sequences and [training the muscle memory in my pinky to perform bizarre contortions] of my left hand just to save my file, I became a convert. I found out a few months later that the developer who convinced me to use [emacs] was a [vi] user all along. I think I was a victim of a cruel joke or hazing ritual, but I learned to love [emacs], and when I am not coding in a desktop IDE ([IntelliJ]) then I am using [emacs].

However most base server installs don't come with [emacs], and [emacs] installs a ton of extra libraries and dependencies. [Emacs] often takes a considerable bit of time to install as packages are downloaded and compiled depending on the platform.

As the world, and my company has been rapidly moving to containerization, I find [Docker] installed on more servers. [Docker] lets me leverage something I have been doing a lot of lately: container-as-command. Like monolithic or microservices, websites, databases, and on and on, containers give us dependency isolation. So with the only requirement being [Docker], I can run any utility that I can slide into a little [Alpine Linux] container.

## Running [emacs]

Since I don't want to type out a long `docker run` command every time I want [emacs] I give my `.bashrc` an alias command.

```bash
alias emacs='docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/src -v "$HOME":/root cjimti/emacs'
```

Now I source my `.bashrc` with `source ~/.bashrc` and I instantly have [emacs] on any [Docker] installed server or workstation. I use this on my local workstation as well as servers.

**WARNING:** Mounting a home directory with an unknown container can be a big security problem, and you would need a lot of trust in the container you are letting mount this directory. 

1. You can use the [cjimti/emacs] container as-is and trust me.
2. You can use the [cjimti/emacs] container as-is and adjust the alias not to mount your home directory. Use a [persistent volume] for .emacs and related files.
3. [You can make your own container](https://github.com/cjimti/cmd-emacs).
