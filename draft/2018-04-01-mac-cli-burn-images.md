Use your terminal to burn images fast and easy with **[dd]**. I do a lot of professional and hobby development for projects using devices such as [Raspberry Pi], [Orange Pi], [Libre Computer], [Tinker Board], etc. I run across a lot of tutorials with people downloading and using big GUI apps with clunky drag and drop interfaces to burn images.

It's one command in your terminal. Technically, it's three, but I don't count listing and unmounting as the final act of burning.

## 1 - List Disks

Insert your SD card and from the command line use [diskUtil] to lists all your drives.

```bash
diskUtil list
```
<script src="https://gist.github.com/cjimti/059b841f492506936f2950c463b46d50.js"></script>

You are going to want to stay away from disk0 and disk1. You don't want to kill your hard drive. Also, watch out for other attached storage. I can see my 32g mounted as **/dev/disk3**.

## 2 - Unmount Disks

Unmount the SD card. In my case, it's **/dev/disk3**. If you have additional attached storage, your SD card might be disk 4, 5, or higher.

```bash
diskUtil unmounDisk /dev/disk3
```

## 3 - Burn Image

The last step is the fantastic little utility **[dd]**. [dd] copies any file to almost anywhere. We can use dd to stream the raw bytes from the image directed to our unmounted disk. On a Mac, the raw disk is accessed with an **r** in front of the device name. Raw access to my /dev/disk3 is /dev/**r**disk3. Give three arguments.

| Arg | Description / Value |
| --- | ---------------- |
| if= | **In file**: Specify the path to the file you want to send |
| of= | **Out file**: Specify the path to the file to be written. Yes, the device is a file. Remember in Unil/Linux/Max everything is a file. So /dev/rdisk99 is a file (it's a device, but we operate on it as a file) |
| bs= | **Block size**: dd streams the data it reads from if= in chunks. Depending on the capabilities of the device writing larger chunks will speed up the write. |

Example dd command to burn images:

```bash
sudo dd if=Armbian.img of=/dev/rdisk3 bs=5m
```

I find that a block size of 5m is the sweet spot for my card reader and the SD cards I use (SanDisk Ultra 32G).

You need to use **sudo** as only a privileged user can write directly to a device in this manner, which is good since you can easily overwrite your hard drive on disk 0 or 1.

Wait for **dd** to finish or hit Control-T from time-to-time for some status.

An 8GB image takes about 10-15 minutes on my workstation depending on the quality of the SD card. Cheap or damaged cards will take a very long time to write.

I have tried a few of the full GUI apps for burning but don't seem to get the speed and control of just typing a few commands.
