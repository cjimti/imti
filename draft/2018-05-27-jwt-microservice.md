[txToken] is a small high performance [microservice] utility container. [txToken] is used for adding [JSON Web Token][JWT] based security to existing or new API development. [txToken] is specifically for systems that communicate in JSON over HTTP. [txToken] is called from a client with a JSON post body and passes received JSON to a remote endpoint. JSON retrieved from a remote endpoint is used to create a [JWT] token with an [HS256] symmetrically encrypted signature.

### Overview

![txToken Proxy](/images/content/txToken-00.png)

[txToken] exposes an HTTP POST endpoint accepting JSON data, used to make a proxied POST to a remote server along with a preset bearer token. Validation of this token on the remote side is optional and only needed if the remote wishes to authenticate the [txToken] call using the shared key.

[txToken] can be run as a standalone binary on amd64 or arm6/7 based systems, however [txToken] is most at home in it's [Docker container][Docker] within a [Kubernetes] cluster.

### Implementation

For demonstration, assume the existence of a fictional API endpoint, something like `https://auth.exmaple.com/login`. **login** excepts POST body data in the form of JSON.

Example login:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://auth.examle.com/login \
  -d '{"email":"john.d@example.com","password":"12345"}'
```


Assuming verified credentials, our fictional **login** API returns an HTTP 200 status along with a JSON string containing info about the user.

Example login return data:

```json
{
  "status": "active",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe"
}
```

If this were a real login service, we might also include an access control list, preferences or anything else we want a client to provide in subsequent calls to our broader system.

This fictional login service is secure, we POSTed credentials over SSL and although our example uses a password value of `12345` a real-world user would be required to have a more complex password, or even a public key or certificate, whatever the **login** service requires to authenticate the caller and send back relevant, trusted data. As long as this remote endpoint sends back JSON with an HTTP 200 status code [txToken] accepts it.

### Architecture Considerations

In a [monolithic] system this **login** endpoint would generate a [JWT] token, and no further action is needed. However, in our [microservice] architecture the **login** endpoint is designed to be generic and only provide user data after validating credentials. Our example **login** service validates an email and password combination from a JSON payload and provides user details; **logic** is agnostic to higher level implementors.

As a [microservice], this **login** endpoint is a generic user object **getter**, therefore implicitly supporting any number of authentication and ACL services above it.

In [microservice] architectures the system is a heavy user of its own API endpoints. Instead of using distributed libraries to share functionality among components [microservices][microservice] share API endpoints.

### Cryptographically Signed Data

Our fictional **login** service returns a user object to its caller. However, the caller may be an untrusted user or system out of the scope and control of our system. [txToken] allows us to sign the object cryptographically, this allows other services within our system to verify the contents of the token.

[txToken] is easy to setup, it runs as a single binary or docker container. [txToken] reads a yaml configuration file from a path specified by the environment variable **CFG_FILE**.

Example `txtoken-config.yml`

```yaml
# Example configuration
port: 8888
debug: true
encKey: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" # 32-64 character string
remote: https://auth.example.com/login
expHours: 1
getTokenRoute: "/getToken"
checkTokenRoute: "/checkToken"
requestTokenData:
  authorization: "internal"
```

In this example [txToken] services any HTTP POST to `/getToken` and `/checkToken` on port `8888` of the localhost. Securing [txToken] communication over SSL is the responsibility of the network layer; I use [kubernetes ingress] for this.

In the example configuration above, a client posts JSON to `/getToken` just as it would have to the **login** endpoint (fictional example above). [txToken] then issues a POST call to endpoint specified in the `remote` key of the yaml config using the JSON it received from the client.

[txToken] expects the `remote` endpoint to return an HTTP 200 status code along with JSON data.

If the `remote` endpoint does not return an HTTP 200 status code [txToken] will return an HTTP 500 status code and a message reflective of the failure:

```json
{
    "message": "Remote post status failure.",
    "status": 500
}
```

If [txToken] receives an HTTP 200 along with valid JSON data the data is encoded and signed as a [JWT] token.

Example response (truncated):

```json
{ "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6..." }
```

### Configuration and Implementation

The following provides examples of a simple [Docker] run command, a `docker-compose` configuration and a sample [kubernetes] configuration:

In each of the following implementations, I use the same configuration yaml.

Download and edit the example configuration to your meet your needs. The following [curl] command pulls the contents of the official example file `example_cfg.yml` and populates a new file called `txtoken.yml`. You can customize the config file name; however, I'll stick with `txtoken.yml` for the examples below.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/txn2/txtoken/master/example_cfg.yml >txtoken.yml
```

The config file consists of the following directives:

#### Config YAML

| key  | description |
| --- | --- |
| `port:` | TCP port to listen on. Port 80 is a reasonable choice when using it for standalone Docker containers or in Kubernetes.|
| `debug:` | Debug mode increases the verbosity of log output. |
| `encKey` | The encryption key is a text string between 32 and 64 characters long used for [HS256] symmetrical encryption of the [JWT] signature.|
|`remote` |  The remote endpoint accepting JSON POST data and returning an HTTP 200 status code with JSON data.|
|`expHours`| expHours defines the number of hours a token is valid by setting the [JWT] token expiration date. Clients can use a token indefinitely, or request new tokens any time, however, a token older than the specified hours should not be considered valid be a system consuming the token.|
|`getTokenRoute:`| Customize the internal POST route for token generation. |
|`checkTokenRoute:` | Customize the internal POST route for token validation. |
|`requestTokenData` | The default here produces the following JSON `{"authorization": "internal"}`. You can add any JSON string to `requestTokenData`, however, since [YAML is a superset of JSON] you can add a YAML formatted key/value tree as you would a plain-text JSON string.  **Read more on `requestTokenData` below.** |

#### requestTokenData

[txToken] proxies JSON POST data to an endpoint defined in `remote:` along with a with a [Bearer Token] in the request header. The `remote:` endpoint can use this for internal authentication. Utilization of the [Bearer Token] supplied by [txToken] to the `remote:` endpoint is optional. However, this may be useful as a secure and fast means of authenticating requests to the `remote:` API endpoint.


##### Docker Run

Run the following command to fire up [txToken] in the foreground and watch the logs:

```bash
docker run --rm \
    -e CFG_FILE=/config/txtoken.yml \
    -v $(pwd)/cfg.yml:/config/txtoken.yml \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    txn2/txtoken
```

In a separate terminal issue a [curl] call to [txToken]:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http:/localhost:8888/getToken \
  -d '{"email":"john.d@example.com","password":"12345"}'
```

##### Docker Compose

Create `docker-compose.yml` consisting of:

```yaml
version: "3.2"

services:
  txtoken:
    image: txn2/txtoken:latest
    volumes:
      - ./txtoken.yml:/config/txtoken.yml
    environment:
        CFG_FILE: /config/txtoken.yml
    ports:
      - "8888:8888"
```

Run `docker-compose` in the foreground to watch the logs:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

In a separate terminal issue a [curl] call to [txToken]:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://auth.examle.com/login \
  -d '{"email":"john.d@example.com","password":"12345"}'
```

##### Kubernetes

The following is an example of a [Service], [ConfigMap], [Deployment], and [Ingress] combined into one file:

If you found this article useful, you may want to check out [all my articles on Kubernetes][phc.txn2.net], used to build on the [Production Hobby Cluster], an excellent environment for developing and testing cloud-native microservices like [txToken]. While using Minikube or similar environments for testing and developing cloud-native [microservice]s, I find it a much better experience to use a more true-to-production cluster.

If in a few days you find yourself setting up a [Production Hobby Cluster] in Japan or Germany on [Linode], and another two in Australia and France on [vultr], then you may have just joined the PHC (Performance [Hobby Cluster]s) club. Some people tinker late at night on their truck, we benchmark and test the resilience of node failures on our overseas, budget kubernetes clusters. It's all about going big, on the cheap.
