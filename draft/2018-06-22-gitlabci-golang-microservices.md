Many of the resources on Cloud Native [Microservices] show you how easy it is to get up and running with AWS or GKE. I think this is great but for the fact that I see a trend (in my clients at least) of associating concepts with particular products or worse, companies. I love Amazon, but it's not THE cloud). In my opinion, to embrace Cloud Native and [Microservices] you should develop some, and host them yourself. The cloud is not Google or Amazon; it's any cluster of virtualized systems, abstracted from their hardware interfaces and centrally managed.

The following workflow currently manages dozens of projects for me, some of which have been through thousands of builds; I find it highly stable. This workflow is also much more flexible and customizable than a lot of turn-key solutions. It requires a bit of explanation but typically only involves about twenty minutes of setup per microservice application, well worth the investment considering you get a simplified build and deploy script.

## Overview

If you are like me your early days were developing Java or Perl scripts that were installed on dev, staging or production hardware and executed under the Apache or Tomcat web servers, and that may still be part of your architecture today. Big monolithic applications, running on big fast servers that you could visit at the data center. However many developers like myself have started moving new development to Cloud Native [Microservices]. The process of deploying monoliths is not really any different, except that while traditional monoliths do not tend to run in containers, they can.

Many tutorials I run across assume you might get to live in a utopian world, where all your code is open source and hosted on public [Github] repositories and deployment means up and running a local, single node [k8s] cluster like Minikube. To be fair, this simplifies the technical details of the examples, and it broadens the audience by giving local sandbox examples that you can adapt to your production environment,  and helps many of us quickly get our head around novel concepts. This tutorial is intended to be applied directly to a production development process.

## A Microservice Stack

I choose five technologies in my workflow to give you some examples. I am referring to open source (and free) software only, not services.

- **Kubernetes with [Alpine Linux] Docker** containers is the core of my cloud. This cloud can be run almost anywhere from AWS to [Vultr], [Digital Ocean], [Linode] or some co-located servers you have running in a data center. If you want to learn how to set up a production style Kubernetes cluster on the cheap, I suggest reading my post, [Production Hobby Cluster]. The [Production Hobby Cluster] tutorial gets you a legit, highly available, three node Kubernetes cluster for about $15 a month. Don't plan on hosting Netflix on it, but when you need to scale your architecture it won't require a complete overhaul. Larger instances and more of them is often all that is needed to scale the [Production Hobby Cluster] from hobby to enterprise.

- **[Golang]** / [Go][Golang] to write your [Microservices], those small API endpoints that satisfy some simple, single or small group of requirements. I use [Go][Golang] because it compiles to a self-sufficient little binary that runs at home in the [smallest of Docker containers][Building Docker Images for Static Go Binaries] and is able to efficiently serve raw TCP or HTTP traffic on a specified port. Go is also an excellent language for [extending the cloud itself][Extending Kubernetes: Create Controllers for Core and Custom Resources], but that is a bit much for this article.

- **[Gitlab]** is my choice for self-hosted code and CI/CD (Automation). Github is fantastic and any code I do not need to keep private goes straight there; however, even my open source projects get cloned into Gitlab so I can take advantage of its simple build and deployment automation. I run [a private copy of Gitlab in my cloud][Installing GitLab on Kubernetes]. Some of my older projects run through Jenkins, and it's an excellent tool but overkill these days for most of my workflow, now that [Gitlab] has matured. Rather than pay for services I would rather pay for instances to grow my cluster and self-host more services.


## The Microservice Application

The following is a simplified workflow for a [Microservices] application and one or more libraries as separate repositories. Not every lib needs its own. However, it's a good idea to separate any libraries that many projects share. Examples would be common [structs] or system-wide service implementations.

- **The Microservice application**: `/go/src/gitlab.example.com/proj/app`
- **A library**: `/go/src/gitlab.example.com/lib/example`

### Workflow & Boilerplate

[Golang] with [Gitlab] and [Kubernetes], Microservice application, file structure boilerplate:

```bash
README.md
main.go
Dockerfile
./k8s/dev
    10-namespace.yml
    20-service.yml
    30-config.yml
    40-deployment.yml
    50-ingress.yml
    README.md
.gitlab-ci.yml
```

I'll start at the top of the list and work down. Every repository needs a **README.md** with simple instruction for development and deployment, environment variables and build considerations. I opt for brief and straightforward documentation; I want my documentation as maintainable as my code. [Microservices] should have micro-documentation, everything you need and not more.

##### Source: `main.go` (`server.go`)

Most of my [Microservices] development start with something similar to this [server.go](https://github.com/txn2/boilerplate-go/blob/master/server.go) boilerplate, using fast and simple [gin-gonic](https://gin-gonic.github.io/gin/) for web/api framework and Uber's [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) for "Blazing fast, structured, leveled logging".

What you don't see in the boilerplate are a few private libs that get added in depending on the project or specific service. These system-wide libs share business logic and import from the private Gitlab repository.

```golang
import (
    "private-gitlab.example.com/some/lib"
    "private-gitlab.example.com/some/otherlib"
)
```

It can be tricky allowing external build systems to pull these private libraries; however, that is overcome easily with Gitlab tokens and some updates to the `Dockerfile` and `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

##### Container: `Dockerfile`

Nearly all my [Microservices] use the same `Dockerfile`. There are some adjustments and variations, but most of the time this boilerplate gives me exactly what I need, a compiled binary in a super small Alpine Linux container.

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.10.2-alpine3.7 AS builder

ARG GITLAB_TOKEN
ARG GITLAB_DOMAIN

RUN apk update \
 && apk add git

RUN mkdir -p /go/src \
 && mkdir -p /go/bin \
 && mkdir -p /go/pkg

ENV GOPATH=/go
ENV PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH

RUN mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/app
ADD . $GOPATH/src/app

ADD . /go/src

WORKDIR $GOPATH/src/app

# go get uses git to pull lib dependencies
RUN git config --global url."https://oauth2:$GITLAB_TOKEN@$GITLAB_DOMAIN".insteadOf "https://$GITLAB_DOMAIN"

RUN go get .
RUN go get github.com/json-iterator/go
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -tags=jsoniter -a -installsuffix cgo -o /go/bin/server .

FROM alpine:3.7

WORKDIR /

COPY --from=builder /go/bin/server /server
ENTRYPOINT ["/server"]
```

**Grab a copy with wget if you like:**
```bash
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/cjimti/c988db3ff1a798eb3e18d76f3d71e75a/raw/adfaadc34c643f1af2c6ddfdc91aba80d6322fb7/Dockerfile
```

If your service needs to communicate out over https, you need to add `RUN apk add --no-cache ca-certificates` to install root certificates. However, I like to keep my containers as small as possible 5-15 megabyte range, so I only add what I need for the service. I could get these even smaller using [`scratch`][Building Docker Images for Static Go Binaries], but I find **Alpine Linux** a good balance.

An important feature of this Dockerfile is allowing `go` to `go get` libraries from the private Gitlab repository.  The two `ARG` lines, `GITLAB_TOKEN` and `GITLAB_DOMAIN` are populated in [docker build] command found `.gitlab-ci.yml` that I go over further down this article. The git configuration directive `RUN git config --global url."https://oauth2:$GITLAB_TOKEN@$GITLAB_DOMAIN".insteadOf "https://$GITLAB_DOMAIN"` tells git to prepend `oauth2:$GITLAB_TOKEN` when pulling from `$GITLAB_DOMAIN`. Since our `$GITLAB_DOMAIN` is a private repository we need to use a token to authenticate from within the Docker container during the build process.

I generate a Gitlab token from a generic user that has access to all the repositories containing my privately shared libraries.

To test this container locally, you can run the [docker build] command found in `.gitlab-ci.yml` below.

```bash
docker build --build-arg GITLAB_TOKEN=$GITLAB_TOKEN \
--build-arg GITLAB_DOMAIN=$GITLAB_DOMAIN \
-t example_app .
```

First, you need to obtain a token from Gitlab, see below.

##### [Gitlab User Token]

You need to create a [Gitlab] user with access to specific repositories, groups, or all (or use your personal account if you work solo). If your team is small, you may not need fine-grained security here. Remember we only need read-only access, so it's not essential to keep the secret safe from anyone who already had read access. Make sure to copy the generated token to your notes for use further down to configure the Gitlab project.

![Gitlab Access Tokens](https://mk.imti.co/images/content/gitlab_access_tokens.png)

All you need is the generated token; the **Name** is used for keeping track of your tokens in **Gitlab**.

#### Gitlab Project Settings: Secret Variables

Assuming you have already setup a Gitlab repository for your Microservice, add the **Secret variables** `GITLAB_DOMAIN` (should be something like gitlab.example.com), review its use in the `Dockerfile` above, and GITLAB_TOKEN, the one we just generated. GITLAB_TOKEN allows `go get` to pull private libraries in from your imports.

There are ways to avoid having to `go get` dependencies, by using utilities like `godeps` and pre-packaging required libraries; you don't have to retrieve at build time. However, this can also make development difficult if you are actively developing those libraries at the same time, as I often do. The configuration above gives you the option to do it either way.

![Gitlab Project Settings](https://mk.imti.co/images/content/gitlab_ci_cd_settings.png)

#### Kubernetes: `./k8s/dev`

My workflow starts with deploying a minimally working version of my microservice to a development environment; this can be a separate cluster, a just a separate [namespace]. I use a separate cluster. Setting up a cheap development cluster is easy and gives you more opportunities to experiment; check out [Production Hobby Cluster] for an agile environment perfect for development and experimentation.

We use [kubectl] to configure and deploy the new service. I'll assume you have some familiarity with it. [kubectl] makes it easy to switch between multiple clusters: `kubectl config use-context phc-dev`, see my post, [kubectl Context Multiple Clusters](https://mk.imti.co/kubectl-remote-context/) for a detailed example.

##### Namespace: `./k8s/dev/10-namespace.yml`

I use a pretty standard form for all my Kubernetes objects. This example assumes we have a project called `the-project` and consists of many [Microservices]. Although the [namespace] is at the project level and not specific to a service, I keep a copy in each service. Duplicating this namespace configuration helps document the service and Kubernetes does not add the namespace if it already exists.

I also label every configuration with a **client** and **env**, this aids in selection rules and adds additional clarity of purpose.

**./k8s/dev/10-namespace.yml**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: the-project
  labels:
    client: internal
    env: dev
```

##### Service: `./k8s/dev/20-service.yml`

[Services] are persistent in Kubernetes. While [Pods] come and go, [Services] stick around and attach themselves to any [Pods] that match their selection rules. I like to setup services first to help illustrate this decoupled nature.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: example-microservice
  namespace: the-project
  labels:
    app: example-microservice
    client: internal
    env: dev
spec:
  selector:
    app: example-microservice
  ports:
    - protocol: "TCP"
      port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
  type: ClusterIP
```

Most of my services attach to [Pods] with the same name as the service. The **name:** of my Kubernetes object and **app:** labels nearly always match. I never prefix or suffix the object type as I have seen in some tutorials, this makes [kubectl] commands cleaner. Here are some examples of selecting all objects associated with a Microservice:

```bash
kubectl get all -l app=example-microservice -n the-project
```

I use **ClusterIP** for **type:** because I don't need a publicly accessible IP address or port. I use [Ingress on Custom Kubernetes] for external access.

##### Config: `./k8s/dev/30-config.yml`

Configuration using **30-config.yml** is optional since many of my [Microservices] share the same configuration. However, the setup is the same.

**Example `./k8s/dev/30-config.yml`**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: example-microservice
  namespace: the-project
  labels:
    app: example-microservice
    client: internal
    env: dev
data:
  dev_config.yml: |
    something:
      important: true
    token:
      encKey: "somethingsecure"
      expHours: 24
    cassandra:
      cluster: ["lax1.cas.example.com","ny1.cas.example.com"]
      keyspace: dev_app
```

In the deployment configuration below we mount this [ConfigMap] into the file system of our [Pod]. Mounting a [ConfigMap] as files allow our service to test outside the cloud with plain configuration files easily.

##### Deployment: `./k8s/dev/40-deployment.yml`

```bash
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example-microservice
  namespace: fuse
  labels:
    app: example-microservice
    client: internal
    env: dev
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example-microservice
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example-microservice
        client: internal
        env: dev
    spec:
      imagePullSecrets:
        - name: example-microservice-regcred # see k8s/README.md
      volumes:
        - name: config-volume
          configMap:
            # ConfigMap specified in 30-config.yml
            name: example-microservice
      containers:
        - name: api5-auth
          # subsequent releases will use gitlab dev-PIPELINE_ID
          image: private-registry.example.com:5050/the-project/example-microservice:dev-latest
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          volumeMounts:
          - name: config-volume
            mountPath: /configs
          env:
            - name: BASE_PATH
              value: "/example/api/endpoint"
            - name: CONFIG
              value: "/configs/dev_config.yml"
            - name: DEBUG
              value: "true"
            - name: PORT
              value: "8080"
            - name: AGENT
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.name
          ports:
            - name: tcp
              containerPort: 8080
```

Before running you need another token from Gitlab: a Deploy Token Kubernetes needs to pull the image from Gitlab's repository.

##### Gitlab Project Settings: Generate Gitlab Deploy Token

In Gitlab under the repository settings for your **example-microservice**, choose **Repository** and expand the **Deploy Tokens** section. Create a deploy token by giving it a name (I leave the expiration empty) and check the **read_registry** scope. You need the generated **Username** and token below, keep them in your notes.

![Gitlab Deploy Token](https://mk.imti.co/images/content/gitlab_deploy_token.png)

 In the `40-deployment.yml` file above you can review the entry under **imagePullSecrets** to see we reference **example-microservice-regcred**.

Create the **example-microservice-regcred** [Secret] in Kubernetes:

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry example-microservice-regcred \
    --namespace=the-project \
    --docker-server=private-registry.example.com:5050 \
    --docker-username=gitlab+deploy-token-8 \
    --docker-password=GHKddKqY1gzW86yllh3x \
    --docker-email=developer@example.com
```

The `kubectl create secret` command creates a special kind of [Secret], [docker-registry](https://Kubernetes-v1-4.github.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/kubectl_create_secret_docker-registry/) used by Kubernetes when issuing pulls for Docker containers. This secret is made available for all the [deployments] in the `the-project` [namespace]. The `--docker-server` parameter specifies the repository host and port. In this case, we use the [Gitlab container registry] of our private Gitlab installation. The `--docker-username` and `--docker-password` parameters were generated in the `kubectl create secret docker-registry` command above.

Once the secret is created it can be used by adding `example-microservice-regcred` in the **imagePullSecrets** for our **example-microservice** [deployment].

##### Ingress `./k8s/dev/50-ingress.yml`

Setup [Ingress on Custom Kubernetes] if you have not done so already. You should also secure your [ingress] API endpoints with HTTPS, a secure, free and easy way of doing this involves setting up [Let's Encrypt on Kubernetes] with [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/).

**50-ingress.yml**

The following [Ingress on Custom Kubernetes] configuration directs traffic for **HTTP port 80** and **HTTPS port 443** on our example domain **api.the-project.dev.example.com** to port 8080 on the **example-microservice** we setup in [Services] configuration [`20-service.yml` above](#service-k8sdev20-serviceyml).

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-microservice
  namespace: the-project
  labels:
    app: example-microservice
    client: internal
    env: dev
spec:
  rules:
  - host: api.the-project.dev.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: example-microservice
          servicePort: 8080
        path: /example/api/endpoint
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - api.example.com
    secretName: the-project-dev-production-tls
```

#### Initial Kubernetes Deployment

I never automate the initial configuration and deployment of [Microservices] in Kubernetes. There are a few things that once setup don't need to change per iteration. Packing the install for automatic configuration and deployment is better left to the Kubernetes package manager [Helm], and after development iterations have stabilized into a more mature state. In this example workflow we are just getting started.

**The quick way**:

```bash
cd ./k8s/dev

kubectl create -f .
```

**The sane way**:

```bash
cd ./k8s/dev

kubectl create -f ./10-namespace.yml
kubectl create -f ./20-service.yml
kubectl create -f ./30-config.yml
kubectl create -f ./40-deployment.yml
kubectl create -f ./50-ingress.yml
```

You should now have a couple of [Pods], a [Deployment], a [ConfigMap], a [Service] and [Ingress] all labeled with `app: example-microservice` in the [namespace] `the-project`.

List the Kubernetes objects:

```bash
kubectl get po,svc,deploy,ing -l app=example-microservice -n the-project
```

The deployment above fails, erroring on the fact that there is no container image to pull for the [Pod] we specified in the [Deployment]  (`40-deployment.yml`).  You can always build an image and push it to Gitlab's registry before configuring the deployment; however, Kubernetes continues attempts to pull the image. This error is ok and how I typically set up new projects. Since the CI scripts job is to build and deploy by updating an image, it's easier if there is already a [Deployment] waiting for it. This process might make more sense when we review the `.gitlab-ci.yml` CI script below.

#### Automated Builds and Deployments: `.gitlab-ci.yml`


Make sure to first [configure runners] in Gitlab and [enable runners for the current repository]. When you push source code into Gitlab, and CI is enabled. Gitlab executes the instructions found in `.gitlab-ci.yml` if one exists.

The following is an example `.gitlab-ci.yml` I commonly use for building and deploying [Microservices] in Kubernetes. Skim over the file and after I'll go over the critical parts.

```yaml
image: txn2/docker-kubectl

variables:
  DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay2
  GIT_STRATEGY: fetch

before_script:
    - docker login -u gitlab-ci-token -p ${CI_JOB_TOKEN} private-registry.example.com:5050

dev_build:
  stage: build
  only:
    - dev@the-project/example-microservice
  script:
    - docker build -t ${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}:dev-${CI_PIPELINE_ID} -f ./k8s/Dockerfile .
    - docker push ${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}:dev-${CI_PIPELINE_ID}
    - docker tag ${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}:dev-${CI_PIPELINE_ID} ${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}:dev-latest
    - docker push ${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}:dev-latest

# update the deployment image
dev_deploy:
  stage: deploy
  only:
    - dev@the-project/example-microservice
  variables:
    GIT_STRATEGY: none
  script: |
    kubectl set image deployment/example-microservice cog=${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}:dev-${CI_PIPELINE_ID} \
    --namespace="the-project" \
    --server="${K8S_DEV_SERVER}" \
    --token="${K8S_DEV_TOKEN}" \
    --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
```

##### Runner `image: txn2/docker-kubectl`

The build script uses Docker and `kubectl`. You can use any base image and install these as part of the build and deploy stages; however, I find it faster to use an image with these utilities already installed. Use the Docker container [txn2/docker-kubectl] or create your own.

**Dockerfile** for Gitlab Kubernetes deployments:
```dockerfile
FROM docker:latest

RUN apk update
RUN apk add curl

RUN curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/Kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/Kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
RUN chmod u+x kubectl && mv kubectl /bin/kubectl
```

If you choose to create a custom container, you need to make sure it is publicly accessible. [Docker Hub][txn2/docker-kubectl] hosts public images free of charge. You are welcome to stick with [txn2/docker-kubectl]

##### Runner `before_script`

The runner needs access to push Docker containers it builds back to the [Gitlab container registry]. [GitLab CI/CD Variables] provides the `CI_JOB_TOKEN` specifically for registry authentication. We don't need Docker access for every stage. However, it's a minor operation to issue a [Docker login], so it's one less thing we have to think about should we require access in later stages; for instance, a testing stage that may tag containers as passing or failing.

**Excerpt from [.gitlab-ci.yml]**
```yaml
before_script:
    - docker login -u gitlab-ci-token -p ${CI_JOB_TOKEN} private-registry.example.com:5050
```

##### Runner `dev_build`

The `deb_build` might look a little complicated, but it is only the [docker build], [docker tag] and [docker push] commands along with the use of a few  [GitLab CI/CD Variables].

The [GitLab CI/CD Variables] used:

 - **`CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE`** returns the address of the registry tied to the specific project.
 - **`CI_PIPELINE_ID`** is the unique id of the current pipeline that GitLab CI uses internally. This variable gives us an always incrementing number, and this helps to distinguish our new container from a previously built one more easily. We could use a separate versioning system or even re-tag with an assigned version number after passing some test. The options are limitless.

**Excerpt from [.gitlab-ci.yml]**
```yaml
dev_build:
  stage: build
  only:
    - dev@the-project/example-microservice
  script:
    - docker build -t ${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}:dev-${CI_PIPELINE_ID} -f ./k8s/Dockerfile .
    - docker push ${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}:dev-${CI_PIPELINE_ID}
    - docker tag ${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}:dev-${CI_PIPELINE_ID} ${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}:dev-latest
    - docker push ${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}:dev-latest
```

The `dev_build:` section **only:** to ensure the `dev_build:` script is run when the **dev** branch of the main repository receives a merge (after a pull request is approved). The directive `dev@the-project/example-microservice` ensures it does not run on forks of this repository.

Tagging a container `dev` lets us know that this container is not yet ready for production, it may need testing or may contain features not yet approved for production deployment. Additional tags can easily be given to this image in later stages, or new containers can be generated specifically for production.

This workflow assumes four or more git branches. In the example [.gitlab-ci.yml] I only cover operations on the **dev** branch, but you can easily extrapolate how **stg** and **prod** branches might work.

| Branch | Purpose |
|    --- | ---     |
| **dev** | The **dev** branch is anything in development, even features that may never be released. The code in the **dev** branch is continuously built and deployed to a development environment.|
| **stg** | The **stg** branch is for staging a service for the next production release, and any merges to the **stg** branch are built and deployed to the staging environment to await final approval for production release.|
| **prod** | The **prod** branch contains code reflecting the current state of production and any code pushed to the **prod** branch is release to the production environment. |
| **master** | The **master** branch is a reflection of the **prod** branch with no CI/CD triggers or jobs associated with it. |

##### Runner `dev_deploy`

In this example the **stage: deploy** runs directly after **stage: build**. In a more sophisticated setup, we may want to run some tests before and after a development deployment.

The **`dev_deploy:`** script deploys our new container with one command: [kubectl set image]. Setting a new image on a [Deployment] triggers Kubernetes to pull the new image, spin up the defined number of required [Pods], then shut down any pods running the previous image. [Rolling updates] are a powerful feature of Kubernetes and help prevent any downtime if handled correctly.

**Excerpt from [.gitlab-ci.yml]**
```yaml
# update the deployment image
dev_deploy:
  stage: deploy
  only:
    - dev@the-project/example-microservice
  variables:
    GIT_STRATEGY: none
  script: |
    kubectl set image deployment/example-microservice example-microservice=${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}:dev-${CI_PIPELINE_ID} \
    --namespace="the-project" \
    --server="${K8S_DEV_SERVER}" \
    --token="${K8S_DEV_TOKEN}" \
    --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
```

Note the new variables **K8S_DEV_SERVER** and **K8S_DEV_TOKEN**.

| Parameter | Purpose |
| ---      | ----     |
| `--server="${K8S_DEV_SERVER}"` | Tells [kubectl] what cluster to use. |
| `--token="${K8S_DEV_TOKEN}"` | used for [authentication]. |

If your [custom Kubernetes cluster][Production Hobby Cluster] uses Role-based access control ([RBAC]), and it should, use the following steps to get a token granting `kubectl` access to `the-project` namespace.

You can combine three configuration directives into one yaml file and get the objects you need in Kubernetes. You need a [ServiceAccount], a [Role] and a [RoleBinding] tying the two together.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  namespace: the-project
  name: the-project
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: the-project
  name: deployer
rules:
- apiGroups: ["apps","extensions"]
  resources: ["deployments","configmaps","pods","secrets","ingresses"]
  verbs: ["create","get","delete","list","update","edit","watch","exec","patch"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: deployer
  namespace: the-project
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  namespace: the-project
  name: the-project
roleRef:
  kind: Role #this must be Role or ClusterRole
  name: deployer # this must match the name of the Role or ClusterRole you wish to bind to
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

You need to extract the generated token from a [secret] automatically created for the new [ServiceAccount].

```bash
kubectl describe serviceaccount the-project -n fuse


Name:                the-project
Namespace:           the-project
Labels:              <none>
Annotations:         <none>
Image pull secrets:  <none>
Mountable secrets:   the-project-token-bc7d2
Tokens:              the-project-token-bc7d2
Events:              <none>
```

The **Tokens:** key points to the name of the [secret] holding the token we need:

```bash
kubectl describe secret the-project-token-bc7d2 -n the-project
```

Under the **token:** key in the described [secret], cut and past this long password. The token is useful for any application needing to deploy into the-project [namespace].

Next, paste the key into Gitlab along with the path to your Kubernetes cluster.

**Giltab Project** > **Settings (gear)** > **CI/CD** > **Secret variables**:

![Gitlab secret variables](https://mk.imti.co/images/content/gitlab_secret_variables_2.png)

These four variables allow Gitlab to communicate with its own registry from a container in the **build stage** with `GITLAB_DOMAIN` and `GITLAB_TOKEN`, and allow it to communicate with Kubernetes in the **deploy stage** with `K8S_DEV_SERVER` and `K8S_DEV_TOKEN`.

## Conclusion

The process above takes me about twenty minutes per microservice application to setup. Considering that these projects may be around for years, and go through hundreds or even thousands of builds makes this a minimal investment in time.

Streamlining this workflow can be accomplished with utilities like the Kubernetes package manager [Helm]. However, caution is advised to ensure that every step in the workflow should make the workflow more clear and easy to visualize and understand a year from now. We should not be developing workflows for the sake of the workflow setup process. Build and deploy pipeline should make the process of using them and debugging them easy, years after they are up and running.
