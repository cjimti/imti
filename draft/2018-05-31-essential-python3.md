This article is a quick tour of basic [Python] 3 syntax, components and structure. I intend to ballance a cheat sheet format with hello world style boilerplates. If you are already a software developer and need a quick refresh on [Python] then I hope you benefit from my notes below.

I am a professional software developer for a software development company, and for that reason, I work with a lot of languages, expert in some, and ok in others.  I context switch often, and sometimes months in between languages. I  often find myself just needing a quick overview to prime the pump so to say, and rather than keep my notes to myself I thought I would clean them up a bit and publish for anyone needing a quick tour, starting with [Python] and more languages as time and interest permits.

Each of the following code blocks is executable.

### Script Execution

Scripts should execute with the environment available python3.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```

### Script Boilerplate

See [python-boilerplate.com](https://www.python-boilerplate.com/py3+executable) for more boilerplate examples. However, this is a good start for most Python 3 scripts. Read more on [PEP 257 -- Docstring Conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def main():
    """
        Main Function
    """
    print("Python 3")


if __name__ == '__main__': main()
"""
 Ensures main() only gets executed if the script is
 executed directly and not as an include.
"""

```

### Types

Read the official documentation on [Python3 Built-in Types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html).

        print(f'x has the value: {repr(y)} and the id: {id(y)}')  # eg 4361511296

    if x == y:
        print('Simple comparison')
    elif not y:
        print('Not my thing really')
    else:
        print('We should probably refactor...')

    y = False  # no longer the same as y
    if not y:

        print('XOR')

    a = [1,2,3]
    if 2 in a:
        print(f'found 2 in {a}')

    salad = "spinach with cucumber and carrots"
    if 'cucumber' in salad:
        print(f'found a cucumber in {repr(salad)}')

    if 'bug' not in salad:
        print(f'good. no bug in {repr(salad)}')
