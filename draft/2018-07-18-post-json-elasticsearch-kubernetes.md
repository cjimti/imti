IOT devices, Point-of-Sale systems, application events or any client that sends data destined for indexing in Elasticsearch often need to send and forget, however, unless that data is of low value there needs to be assurance that arrives at its final destination. Back-pressure and database outages can pose a considerable threat to data integrity.

**Quick Reference:**

## Background

High availability and high performance often mean burdensome complexity. Data replication, application, network and infrastructure redundancy, anything we can do to avoid a single point of failure. However, what happens when one of those points do fail? Alternatively, a cascade of problems causing slowdowns and back pressure builds to constant far too high for indexing to catch up?

[Pub-Sub] style message queues like Kafka are growing in popularity because they add incredible flexibility to data pipelines, yet these queues can also suffer from data loss and duplication unless you expend sufficient effort in expert tuning and configuration. [Pub-Sub] MQs can also over complicate the architecture depending on requirements. I found myself re-thinking some of my architectures after reading [Why Messaging Queues Suck] by Bob Reselman. I still use messaging queues but have pushed [Pub-Sub] further back from the edge of my stack.

Over the years I have made conscious efforts to move complexity further from the edge. The edge, being the API endpoints relied upon by clients. If I can simplify and harden the edges, then the more sensitive and complex systems deeper down have less exposure to unknowns. An early layer of simplicity not only buffers API calls and data but moves complexity back a rung.

## Overview

In the process below I demonstrate a store and forward setup used for asynchronous data gathering. The clients need to send data, and I need assurance that data makes it to its destination. I don't need the clients waiting for confirmation.

![](/images/content/txn2/rxtx-rtbeat.png)

I use [rxtx] to store-and-forward data to [rtBeat] which publishes it into Elasticsearch. This process of store-and-forward achieved through a batching message queue that can function independently or as a first layer of buffering to larger message queue applications.

Using [rxtx] with [rtBeat] you can achieve high performance, highly available service for accepting JSON POST data and delivering it to Elasticsearch. [rxtx] collects post data, writes it to a local [bbolt] database and sends batches on an interval to rtBeat. [rtBeat] processes the batches of POSTed JSON data and publishes them as events into Elasticsearch. [rtBeat] is an Elastic [beat] and can publish simultaneously to [elasticsearch], [logstash], [kafka] and [redis].

## Development Environment

You need a Kubernetes cluster and an Elasticsearch database running in it. If you don't have a Kubernetes cluster or would like to create a production-like cluster for development or research, I suggest the following articles:

- [Production Hobby Cluster]
- [Production Grade Elasticsearch on Kubernetes]
- [Kibana on Kubernetes]

### the-project Namespace

In continuity with previous tutorials, I'll stick with `the-project` [namespace].

`00-namespace.yml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: the-project
  labels:
    env: dev
```

Create the namespace:
```bash
kubectl create -f 00-namespace.yml
```

## The Project: Weather (wx) Data

In this tutorial, I use weather (wx) data from the [Dark Sky API]. Since the [Dark Sky API] is a service for pulling data, I use a Kubernetes [cronjob](#client-simulation--kubernetes-cron) to pull from the [Dark Sky API] and push into the new service, simulating an IOT based weather client in Los Angeles. Pull and send is a familiar pattern for many data retrieval systems.

## [rxtx] for Store-and-Forward

[![](https://github.com/txn2/rxtx/raw/master/mast.jpg)][rxtx]
[![Docker Container Image Size](https://shields.beevelop.com/docker/image/image-size/txn2/rxtx/latest.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/txn2/irsync/)
[![Docker Container Layers](https://shields.beevelop.com/docker/image/layers/txn2/rxtx/latest.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/txn2/irsync/)
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/txn2/rxtx)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/txn2/rxtx)

[rxtx] is a queue based, store-and-forward data collector and data transmitter useful for online/offline data collection, back pressure buffering or general queuing. [rxtx] uses the highly efficient and fast bbolt maintained by CoreOs. [bbolt] stores message awaiting an interval and the ability to send them.

[rxtx] is written in Golang and originally designed to run in a Docker container on IOT devices with intermittent network connectivity. Because of its simplistic design and network tolerance, it can be a safety net during unexpected outages or slowdown deeper in the system.

[rxtx] listens for HTTP POST requests with JSON data, it stores the data along with a timestamp and sequence number, on a defined interval [rxtx] gathers a batch of JSON messages and in-turn POSTs them to a defined endpoint. [rxtx] can POST to any endpoint accepting POST data yet is designed to work specifically with [rtBeat], which we implement further down.

### wx-rxtx Service

Kubernetes [Services] are the communication hub for a microservices architecture. Services are, and so it makes sense to set them up early on.

Our **wx-rxtx** service look for Pods with the label **app: wx-rxtx** and direct traffic to them on port 80 to port 80 on the Pods.

`wx-rxtx/20-service.yml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wx-rxtx
  namespace: the-project
  labels:
    app: wx-rxtx
    env: dev
spec:
  selector:
    app: wx-rxtx
  ports:
  - protocol: "TCP"
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
```

Create the wx-rxtx service:
```bash
kubectl create -f wx-rxtx/20-service.yml
```

Although it won't do much, at this point we do have a service listening at http://wx-rxtx:80/ from inside the cluster; however, from outside `the-project` namespace it would need to be addressed http://the-project.wx-rxtx:80/.

### wx-rxtx StatefulSet

We use Kubernetes [StatefulSet]s because unlike a Deployment, a [StatefulSet] maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. [rxtx] will use a [PersistentVolume] to store its [bbolt] database. If a Pod it restarted, or a Kubernetes node goes down, a new Pod eventually takes its place and attaches to the existing data.

I recommend running [Ceph] managed by [rook]. "Ceph is a unified, distributed storage system designed for excellent performance, reliability, and scalability." and "Rook orchestrates battle-tested open-source storage technologies including Ceph."

Configuring [Ceph] to replicate your data ensures that with [rxtx] every message is eventually sent, even with a catastrophic failure of multiple Kubernets nodes.

Setting up [Ceph] and [rook] is beyond the scope of this article, but quickly done with their excellent documentation.

`wx-rxtx/40-statefulset.yml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: wx-rxtx
  namespace: the-project
  labels:
    app: wx-rxtx
    env: dev
spec:
  serviceName: wx-rxtx
  replicas: 1 # scale as desired
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wx-rxtx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wx-rxtx
        env: dev
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wx-rxtx
        image: txn2/rxtx:1.2.0
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        args: [
          "--ingest=http://wx-rtbeat:80/in",
          "--port=80",
          "--path=/data",
          "--interval=10", # seconds between intervals
          "--batch=4000",  # maximum batch size
          "--maxq=500000"] # maximum message to store
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wx-rxtx-data-volume
          mountPath: /data
        ports:
        - name: rxtx
          containerPort: 80
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: wx-rxtx-data-volume
    spec:
      storageClassName: rook-block
      accessModes: [ ReadWriteOnce ]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi # enough to hold maxq
```

Create the wx-rxtx statefulset:
```bash
kubectl create -f wx-rxtx/40-statefulset.yml
```

The **wx-rxtx service** should now be able to find **wx-rxtx** Pods deployed by the [StatefulSet] and any data sent to the service http://wx-rxtx:80/ is send to them.


## [rtBeat] to Collect, Buffer and Publish

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/txn2/rtbeat/master/mast-logo.jpg)][rtBeat]
[![Docker Container Image Size](https://shields.beevelop.com/docker/image/image-size/txn2/rtbeat/latest.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/txn2/irsync/)
[![Docker Container Layers](https://shields.beevelop.com/docker/image/layers/txn2/rtbeat/latest.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/txn2/rtbeat/)
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/txn2/rtbeat)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/txn2/rtbeat)

[rtBeat](https://github.com/txn2/rtbeat) processes HTTP POST data from [rxtx](https://github.com/txn2/rxtx) and publishes events into [Elasticsearch], [Logstash], [Kafka], [Redis] or directly to log files.

[rtBeat] is designed to accept batches of JSON data from [rxtx] and publish these batches to Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kafka, and Redis. In this project, we are only publishing to [elasticsearch]. However, you can review the [rtBeat configuration] for these other systems.

### wx-rtbeat Service

wx-rtbeat listens internally on the cluster at http://wx-rtbeat:80, we can set up [ingress] to point to this service in the future to allow external access.

`wx-rtbeat/20-service.yml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wx-rtbeat
  namespace: the-project
  labels:
    app: wx-rtbeat
    env: dev
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: wx-rtbeat
  ports:
  - name: rtbeat
    protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
```

Create the wx-rtbeat Service:
```bash
kubectl create -f wx-rtbeat/20-service.yml
```

### wx-rtbeat ConfigMap

A significant part of configuring [rtbeat] involves mapping fields. Although Elastic search does a great job of detecting data types, it's best to be specific when you can. Since we are using data from the [Dark Sky API], we can choose the most appropriate [Elasticsearch data types].

The following [ConfigMap] mounts as a volume into the Pods running [rtbeat].

Within the **rtbeat.yml** section under **output.elasticsearch:** you find **hosts:** set to **"elasticsearch:9200"**. The elasticsearch service running on port 9200 is setup in the tutorial [Production Grade Elasticsearch on Kubernetes].

`wx-rtbeat/30-configmap.yml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: wx-rtbeat
  namespace: the-project
  labels:
    app: wx-rtbeat
    env: dev
data:

```

Create the wx-rtbeat ConfigMap:
```bash
kubectl create -f wx-rtbeat/30-configmap.yml
```
### wx-rtbeat Deployment

The deployment creates a Pod running the [rtbeat] Docker container configured by the [ConfigMap] we created above.

`wx-rtbeat/40-depoloyment.yml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wx-rtbeat
  namespace: the-project
  labels:
    app: wx-rtbeat
    env: dev
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wx-rtbeat
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wx-rtbeat
        env: dev
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: wx-rtbeat
        image: txn2/rtbeat:1.0.2
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        args: ["-e", "--path.config=/config"]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: wx-rtbeat-config-volume
          mountPath: /config
        ports:
        - name: rtbeat
          containerPort: 80
      volumes:
      - name: wx-rtbeat-config-volume
        configMap:
          name: wx-rtbeat
```

Create the wx-rtbeat [Deployment]:
```bash
kubectl create -f wx-rtbeat/40-deployment.yml
```

## Client Simulation / Kubernetes Cron

We could add an [ingress] configuration and expose our wx-rtbeat service to the outside world, allowing IOT devices like weather stations, machine sensors, or anything that can POST JSON data to us. However, for this tutorial, we can more easily simulate a client using a Kubernetes [CronJob].

We create a [CronJob] that issues a request to the [Dark Sky API], receives JSON data and subsequently issues a POST directly to our [rtbeat] service.

I keep my [Dark Sky API] in a Secret and mount the value of the secret to an environment variable accessible in the container used by the cron.

- Sign up for a [Dark Sky API] developer account (free).
- Create a file called **apikey** with your secret API key in it.

Create the Kubernetes secret **wx-data-api-key** in **the-project** namespace:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic wx-data-api-key --from-file=apikey -n the-project
```

`wx-data/40-cron.yml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: wx-data
  namespace: the-project
  labels:
    app: wx-data
    env: dev
spec:
  schedule: "*/2 * * * *"
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
  startingDeadlineSeconds: 90
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: wx-data
            image: txn2/curl:v3.0.0
            env:
            - name: API_KEY
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: wx-data-api-key
                  key: apikey
            - name: DATA_FROM
              value: "https://api.darksky.net/forecast/$(API_KEY)/33.8148455,-117.826581?exclude=minutely,hourly,daily,flags"
            - name: DATA_TO
              value: "http://wx-rxtx:80/rx/cron/collector/wx-data"
            command: [
              "/bin/sh",
              "-c",
              "/usr/bin/curl -sX GET $(DATA_FROM) > data && /usr/bin/curl -sX POST -d @data $(DATA_TO)"
            ]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

Create the wx-data [CronJob]:
```bash
kubectl create -f wx-data/40-cron.yml
```

## Performance

Inserting one record every two minutes is only to demonstrate the process. I run this setup on a few production systems that handle around 200 messages per second and often up to 400 or 500 with only minimal resource used other than data storage.

Scaled [rtBeat] and [rxtx] by increasing the number of replicas to whatever your Kubernetes cluster can handle. [rtBeat] and [rxtx] services run independently allowing infinite horizontal scaling.

## Conclusion

If you have setup [Kibana on Kubernetes], you should begin to see data. You are now able to set up an index, explore your data and create visualizations.
